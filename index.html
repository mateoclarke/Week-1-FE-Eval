					<h3 class="header-font"><a name="about">About</a></h3>
					<p class="about-font">Ozone Bike Dept. started in February of 1992 in Austin Texas as a grassroots bicycle business.  We are in it for the love of bikes.  We started back when Austin was smaller and weirder and Guadalupe had a different look.  Over the course of time we have had the pleasure of meeting almost every two-wheel lover in town.  Our mission statement is "to support cycling in every capacity possible."

					Over time that has meant many different things, but always something cool.  There are six billion plus perspectives on cycling and we thrive on keeping you safe and well adjusted for whatever it means to you.  Service is our focus to keep you rolling.

					The secret formula here is really the people.  We have a very experienced staff that can navigate our inventory well, knows the community, and has first hand experience on riding most of Austin.  They can make your bike sing.

					WE WANT YOU TO TEST RIDE ALL OF OUR BIKES.  Bring valid drivers license.

					Ozone is proud to serve our brands.  We feel they are the best. Kona, Bianchi, Marin, Masi, Haro, Redline, DK, SE, Firemans and Surly.  These brands earned their floor space by proving their value and quality.

					Ozone has great bikes for commuters, trail riders, students, racers and casual riders. We cover categories from BMX to road, 29er to fixie, hardtail to freeride, and anything in between.

					Ozone is able to keep prices low because we shop for customers' budgets. Our mountain bike selection, for example, features the most current models as well as last year's at big discounts. We're always on the lookout for great close-out deals, and if we buy it from our distributors on sale, you'll buy it from us on sale!</p>
